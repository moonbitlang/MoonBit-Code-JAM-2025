/// Component for handling mouse interactions on entities.
///
/// Pickable stores callback functions that are triggered when mouse events
/// occur on an entity. It manages four types of mouse event callbacks: pressed
/// (while held down), released (while not held down), just pressed (at the
/// moment of pressing), and just released (at the moment of releasing).
///
/// Fields:
///
/// * `on_pressed_callbacks` : Callbacks executed while a mouse button is held
///   down on the entity.
/// * `on_released_callbacks` : Callbacks executed while a mouse button is not
///   held down on the entity.
/// * `on_just_pressed_callbacks` : Callbacks executed at the exact moment a
///   mouse button is pressed on the entity.
/// * `on_just_released_callbacks` : Callbacks executed at the exact moment a
///   mouse button is released on the entity.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```moonbit
/// let pickable = Pickable::new()
/// pickable.on_just_pressed(fn(button) { 
///   println("Button \{button} was just pressed") 
/// })
/// pickable.on_pressed(fn(button) { 
///   println("Button \{button} is being held down") 
/// })
/// ```
///

  on_pressed_callbacks : Array[(@inputs.MouseButton) -> Unit]
  on_released_callbacks : Array[(@inputs.MouseButton) -> Unit]

/// Global registry that maps entities to their `Pickable` components for mouse
/// interaction handling.
///
/// This map stores the association between entities and their corresponding
/// `Pickable` components, allowing the collision system to efficiently look up
/// which entities can respond to mouse events. The map is automatically
/// populated when `Pickable` components are attached to entities and is used by
/// the `pickable_click_system` to process mouse interactions.
///
/// The map uses `@system.Entity` as keys to uniquely identify game objects, and
/// `Pickable` as values to store the mouse event callback configurations for
/// each entity.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```moonbit
/// // Register a pickable component for an entity
/// let entity = @system.Entity::new()
/// let pickable = Pickable::new()
/// pickable.on_just_pressed(fn(button) { 
///   println("Entity clicked with button: \{button}") 
/// })
/// @collision.pickables[entity] = pickable
/// ```

/// Processes mouse interaction events for all pickable entities in the game
/// world.
///
/// This system function is called every frame to handle mouse clicks and
/// interactions with entities that have `Pickable` components. It checks both
/// UI entities and world entities against the current mouse cursor position,
/// taking into account camera position and zoom level. For each entity that
/// intersects with the mouse cursor, it executes the appropriate callbacks
/// based on the current mouse button states (pressed, released, just pressed,
/// or just released).
///
/// The system operates in two phases:
///
/// 1. First, it processes UI entities from the `@ui.uis` collection without
/// camera offset
/// 2. Second, it queries world entities using a spatial quadtree and processes
/// them with camera offset applied
///
/// Parameters:
///
/// * `delta` : The time elapsed since the last frame (unused in current
///   implementation).
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```moonbit
/// // Set up a pickable entity
/// let entity = @system.Entity::new()
/// let pickable = @collision.Pickable::new()
/// pickable.on_just_pressed(fn(button) { 
///   println("Entity clicked with \{button}")
/// })
/// @collision.pickables[entity] = pickable
///
/// // The system will automatically call this function each frame
/// let app = @system.App::new()
/// app.add_system(pickable_click_system).run()
